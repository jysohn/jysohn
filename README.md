### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently exploring various Solidity based projects to better understand smart-contract programming. Besides Solidity, I have some past experience in Python and Java. At this time, I'm building an interface on top of AAVE protocol lending pools.

Some of these projects involve building on top of numerous existing tutorials.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building dApps.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on crypto projects.
